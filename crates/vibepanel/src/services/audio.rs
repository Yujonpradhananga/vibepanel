//! AudioService - PulseAudio/PipeWire audio monitoring and control.
//!
//! Provides a GTK/GLib-friendly, callback-based API for:
//! - Monitoring default sink volume and mute state
//! - Monitoring default source (mic) mute state
//! - Enumerating available sinks for quick settings
//! - Setting volume/mute with efficient handling of rapid changes
//!
//! Uses `libpulse-binding` for native PulseAudio protocol access, which
//! works seamlessly with PipeWire's `pipewire-pulse` compatibility layer
//! on most modern Wayland desktops.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - A background thread runs the PulseAudio threaded mainloop
//! - State updates are sent to the GTK main loop via `glib::idle_add_once()`
//!   which wakes the main loop immediately (no polling required)
//! - Volume/mute commands are sent to the background thread via `std::sync::mpsc`
